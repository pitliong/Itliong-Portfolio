# Project 2: Cartons List

## Description
This project is a listing based design that contains the top five entries of cartoons that have not been viewed or since childhood or forgotten in obscurity. The name of this project is entitled, **"5 Cartoons You Never Heard Of,"** and it is done in ***Visual Studio Code.*** This project was the first time I tried my work inn web designing and learned how hard and complex it looks to complete it.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
  - Entry point of the website that contains the structure and elements that defines the site's layout and content
- CSS
  - files that define the website presentation of the web page and specifies the HTML elements.

## Challenges faced
The coding algorithm is highly complex and difficult to master that some of the texts have been smushed together, some texts not being arranged perfectly, and some images just covered up the texts. I have to spend time to alter the width and size of the images and text spacing, as well as the font value of the text, so that viewers can easily read from the website.

## What I learned
I learned how to use use coding styles of CSS and HTML files and the fundamental values of web authoring. Admitedly it looks like it was not yet completed, but the  my teacher from last semester knew that I did my best to complete this project.
