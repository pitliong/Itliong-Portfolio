# Project 3: SharePoint CIS

## Objective
The main objective is to create a SharePoint post that details the CIS degree program, courses, or anything else that talks about the CIS Department and then later post a presentation of the finished SharePoint site upon the final week. Within these three weeks, I had to write down a weekly progress report of my project.

## Methods
Considering that it is the first time using SharePoint, I have to figure out the tools I have to use to finish the projects until the final week and then using the web parts provided within the website.

## Web Parts Used
- YouTube
    - Used to upload my Adobe After Affect Project on my YouTube channel.
- Link
    - Used to add the email links within the bottom part of the project.
- Divider
    - Seperate the sections to make it feel more spacious.
- Images
    - Upload screenshots and web images with and added hyperlinks within the images. Unfortunately, I was unable to add the texts within the image due to size.

## Outcomes
Everything has gone pretty well within the last three weeks. The presentation has gone well, eventhough I somewhat stutter a lot within my several attempts, but I had a lot of fun with SharePoint and learned how to create a site were I can remote myself with the past projects I have done within the CIS Program.
