## What I learned
What I learned from this project is the fundamental values and functions of different tools within the project.
Each coding tool works for the following function that is designated to them:
1. GroupBox
  - gathers and organizes the interfaces of the platter and payment types
2. RadioButtons
  - selection of different items entered in within the GroupBox
3. Label
  - title or subtitle of the coding design
4. TextBox
  - the value of loyalty points that has to be entered.
