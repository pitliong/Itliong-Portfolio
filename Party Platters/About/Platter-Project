# Party Platters

## Description
This projects determines the calculated total cost of the chosen platter, minusing the payment type of the platter and multiplying the loyalty points of the platter chosen.

## Technology Used
The only technology I used in this project is Visual Basic, an event-driven programming language from Microsoft that provied a graphical user interface where programmers can modify codes and defining their designated actions.

## Challenges I faced
After starting the project, the entered cost has a tendency to exceed offscreen based on the width and length of the desktop. I had to lower the constant value of the platters and resize the design to make it more appealing.
